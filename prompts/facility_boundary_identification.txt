You are analyzing a satellite image to identify the boundaries of a specific industrial facility.

## ANCHOR POINT
The facility's pin location is at the exact center of this image. The pin marks the facility you need to identify. Start from the center and work outward.

## WHAT TO INCLUDE IN THE BOUNDARY
- All buildings that belong to this facility (main plant, warehouses, annexes, outbuildings)
- Yards and open areas directly adjacent to the buildings (loading docks, staging areas, storage yards)
- Any on-property areas between buildings that clearly belong to the same operation
- Driveways and internal roads within the facility property
- All areas where materials, equipment, containers, or dumpsters could be stored

## WHAT TO EXCLUDE
- Public roads and highways
- Vegetation and undeveloped land beyond the facility's operational footprint
- Buildings that clearly belong to a different company or operation
- Residential areas

## IDENTIFYING WHICH BUILDINGS BELONG TO THE FACILITY

The pin is placed on or very near the primary building of the target facility.

1. Start with the building directly under or nearest to the pin — this is your anchor building.
2. Look for connected buildings: structures physically attached, sharing walls, or joined by covered walkways/conveyors to the anchor building. These almost certainly belong to the same facility.
3. Look for operationally linked buildings: nearby structures that share the same driveway, parking, yard space, or fencing with the anchor building. These likely belong to the same facility.
4. Look for visual consistency: buildings with similar roof style, construction era, or industrial character that form a coherent campus around the anchor.
5. Identify boundaries between facilities: look for separations like tree lines, fences, different road access points, different parking lots, or a clear gap/change in building style. These indicate where one facility ends and another begins.

## EDGE CASES

### Large facilities with multiple buildings
Some facilities span many buildings across a large area. If buildings share internal roads, common yard space, or are enclosed within the same perimeter (fence line, tree line, or road loop), treat them as one facility even if spread out.

### Industrial parks with many companies
When the facility is inside an industrial park with many similar-looking buildings:
- Trust the pin — the anchor building is the one at center
- Only include adjacent buildings that show clear operational connection to the anchor
- Buildings across a public road or separated by distinct property lines are likely different companies
- When in doubt, draw the boundary tighter rather than wider

### Very small facilities
Some facilities are a single building with minimal surrounding area. That's fine — the boundary can be small.

### Pin slightly offset
Sometimes the pin lands on an administrative office or parking lot rather than the main production building. Look for the nearest industrial/production building and include it. The pin is usually within 50m of the correct facility.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide the facility boundary as pixel coordinates relative to the image:
- top_y: topmost pixel row of the facility boundary
- bottom_y: bottommost pixel row
- left_x: leftmost pixel column
- right_x: rightmost pixel column

Add a 50-meter buffer around the identified operational footprint to ensure nothing is cut off at the edges.

Also provide:
- confidence: high / medium / low
- facility_type: what kind of facility this appears to be (manufacturing plant, warehouse, steel mill, office, etc.)
- building_count: how many distinct buildings are included
- notes: any relevant observations (e.g., "large scrap yard on south side", "facility shares driveway with neighbor")
